## Tech Used
* JavaScript
* Node.js
* Inquirer
## Project Description
This project produces a README file which is generated dynamically as the user types responses to prompts from the Inquirer package running under Node.js. I think this would be phenomenally useful, and I shall certainly be utilising it in the future.

The app is run from the Gitbash CLI after being initialised by Node.js. The responses to the prompts are written to the README file under the relevant headings which are pre-formatted in the index.mjs file.

There are very many different license types, but I used just three options for demonstration purposes.

As this is not being deployed to Github Pages, I have recorded a video which is above and the resulting README file is called "generatedREADME.md".
